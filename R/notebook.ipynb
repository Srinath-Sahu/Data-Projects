This initiative aims to delve into a wealth of data related to flight schedules and operational patterns, with the objective of optimizing flight times and enhancing the overall travel experience for passengers. As the head data analyst, you have access to rich datasets, sourced from the 'nycflights2022' collection produced by the ModernDive team. These datasets include records of flights departing from major New York City airports, including JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), LGA (LaGuardia Airport), and EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport), during the second half of 2022. They offer a comprehensive view of flight operations, covering various aspects such as departure and arrival times, flight paths, and airline specifics:\n\n- `flights2022-h2.csv` contains information
